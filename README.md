# Movie-Recommendation-System
A machine learning-based Movie Recommendation System that suggests movies based on user preferences. This project leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques, cosine similarity, and CountVectorizer to deliver accurate and personalized recommendations.

Content-Based Recommendations: Suggests movies based on genres, cast, keywords, and other attributes.

NLP Techniques: Converts text data into numerical vectors using CountVectorizer.

Cosine Similarity: Measures the similarity between movies to recommend the most relevant options.

User-Friendly Interface: Simple and interactive functionality for easy use

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
IDE:-PyCharm
Libraries:
          Pandas
          NumPy
          scikit-learn
          Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)
